				Navbar example
			</h1>
			<p>
				This example is a quick exercise to illustrate how the default,
				static and fixed to top navbar work. It includes the responsive CSS
				and HTML, so it also adapts to your viewport and device.
			</p>
			<p>
				To see the difference between static and fixed top navbars, just
				scroll.
